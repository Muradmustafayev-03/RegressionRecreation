You can refer to: https://github.com/Muradmustafayev-03/Weather-Forecast as a tutorial to use this library and linear regression in general

To install the package as a library use: 
> *pip install regression*

Then to import:
> *import regression*

---

In this small package you can find the following models: *PolynomialRegressor, LinearRegressor, MultivariateRegressor*.

It can be particularly useful for small projects with relatively small datasets and only reggression models needed, 
because it is very simple and way lighter, than Scikit-learn or its analogs.
